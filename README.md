# SPEECH-RECOGNITION-TECHNIQUES
TO DEVELOP A SPEECH RECOGINITION PROGRAM
Speech recognition techniques in Python involve converting spoken language into text. This process typically starts with capturing audio through a microphone, which transforms sound waves into electrical signals. These signals are then converted from analog to digital format, enabling computer processing.
The core of speech recognition relies on algorithms that analyze audio data, breaking it down into phonemes, the smallest units of sound. Acoustic models, often using Hidden Markov Models or neural networks, identify these phonemes and map them to words. Language models then use statistical probabilities to determine the most likely sequence of words, forming sentences.
